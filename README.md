# Priority Scrambler VHDL Implementation

## Description
This VHDL file contains the implementation of a priority scrambler system. The system takes input data and scrambles it based on certain criteria. The scrambled data is then displayed on an output device.

## Components
- **clock_divider:** Divides the clock frequency.
- **data_register:** Registers input data.
- **display_controller:** Controls the display of data.
- **scrambler:** Performs data scrambling.
- **priority_encoder:** Encodes scrambled data for display.

## Usage
This VHDL file can be used as a module in a larger digital design project. It provides the functionality to scramble input data based on certain conditions and display the scrambled data on output devices.
